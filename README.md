# Cross-Regional Customer Service Chatbot

A multilingual AI Chatbot that offers personalised customer service for banking clients across various regions. Once deployed, this chatbot will be able to operate 24/7 and service clients from anywhere around the globe. It is capable of handling matters ranging from routine inquiries to transaction assistance.

## Problem Statement

In today's globalized economy, banks face the challenge of providing consistent, high-quality customer service across multiple regions and languages, while managing the expectations of clients who demand instant, round-the-clock support. Traditional customer service models struggle to meet these demands due to limitations in human resources, operational hours, and language capabilities. This results in delays, communication barriers, and customer dissatisfaction. A multilingual AI chatbot addresses these issues by leveraging neural networks to deliver personalized, efficient, and scalable customer service, ensuring that clients receive timely assistance regardless of their location or language. This solution not only enhances customer experience but also reduces operational costs and improves service availability.

## Project Description

The Cross-Regional Customer Service Chatbot can be deployed and hosted on platforms such as UOB's TMRW mobile banking application and official website to provide personalized banking support to customers, with a focus on inclusivity, especially, for the diverse financial landscape of Singapore. Our chatbot incorporates an open-source large language model (LLM) that is capable of conversing in various languages. This enhances the overall user experience and opens up the possibility for more meaningful quality interactions.

In addition to its core functionality, a comprehensive interactive dashboard has been developed to monitor and log the chatbot's performance that shapes the customer experience. Developed for administrative users, this dashboard enables real-time insights into customer interactions, helping banks optimize service delivery and continuous developments to the chatbot's effectiveness in delivering quality customer service.

## Features

### Multilingual Support

The AI-powered chatbot is designed to provide seamless and efficient communication across a wide range of languages, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for users from different linguistic backgrounds.

#### Language Detection

- The chatbot automatically detects the language in which a user is communicating. This is achieved via finetuning the LLM on a corpus of linguistic data (i.e capture the nuances of each language).

- Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms analyze the user input query and auto-tags the topic (e.g loans, investing, account creation etc) most relevant to the query for administrative insights and analytics.

#### Language Switching

- Users can switch languages during a conversation without restarting the session. The chatbot seamlessly transitions to the new language, maintaining the context of the conversation. This is particularly useful in multilingual regions or for users who are comfortable using multiple languages.

#### Fallback Mechanism

- In cases where the chatbot encounters text in a language that is not supported or poorly understood, it will provide a fallback response in a default language (e.g., English), and suggest ways for the user to continue the conversation (e.g., using a different language or contacting support).

- Acknowledging the possibilities of inaccurate response and language outputs due to limited model training, customers have the ability to escalate or report a response for adminstrative follow-ups. Such capabilities establishes an auto-feedback channel to facilitate iterative improvements to the overall service.
